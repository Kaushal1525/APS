🚗 Autonomous Parking Simulation
📌 About
This project simulates an Autonomous Parking System using Pygame and Mathematics. The car intelligently navigates towards a designated parking spot while avoiding obstacles.

🎮 Features
✅ Autonomous Parking Logic: The car calculates the shortest path to park itself
✅ Obstacle Avoidance: Detects and maneuvers around obstacles in real-time
✅ Angle & Distance Calculation: Uses trigonometry to align with the parking spot
✅ Smooth Movement & Rotation

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pygame (for rendering simulation)
Math & Trigonometry (for movement calculations)
📊 How It Works
🔹 The car calculates the distance & angle to the parking spot
🔹 It adjusts its angle dynamically to align with the target spot
🔹 If an obstacle is detected, it steers away to avoid collision
🔹 The simulation stops if the car successfully parks or collides# APS
